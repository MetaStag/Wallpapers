## Here is a collection of wallpapers i use.

**NOTE:** None of these walls belong to me, all rights go to their respectful owners.

#### wall.py
This repo also comes with `wall.py`, which is a python cli interface over the wallhaven api. You can browse images based on a search query from your terminal itself (the programm will open images in your default image-viewer).

You can also save these images locally.

###### Features
- Search & view images from your terminal
- Search images based on a specific resolution
- Save images locally
- Browse through multiple pages instead of just one, to find far more wallpapers!

###### Limitations
- Cannot browse pages when searching with resolution
